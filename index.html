            <article id="1">
                <p>Skibidi Toilet is a series of viral YouTube Shorts uploaded on the DaFuq!?Boom! channel on YouTube.
                    The series depicts a war between the Skibidi Toilets — disembodied heads inside moving toilets which
                    can be killed by being flushed down — and a faction of people with hardware for heads, such as
                    camera mans,speaker mans, or TV mans. Skibidi Toilet is produced by Georgian animator Alexey
                    Gerasimov using Source Filmmaker. The first short was posted on 7 February 2023.</p>

                <p>Skibidi Toilet features bizarre visuals with a nonsensical nature, a relatively short running length,
                    and toilet humor, which became viral several months after its debut. It quickly accumulated millions
                    of views, becoming a meme on both YouTube and TikTok. According to Tubefilter, "DaFuq!?Boom!" was
                    the most viewed YouTube channel during June 2023.</p>

                <header><strong>Plot and Characteristics</strong></header>
                <p>The series documents the conflict between human-headed toilets, called Skibidi Toilets, and
                    CCTV-headed people, called Cameramen. A remix of the songs "Give It to Me"[citation needed] by
                    Timbaland and "Dom Dom Yes Yes" by Biser King makes its appearance in every episode as the
                    theme song of the Skibidi Toilets. The events unfold from the perspective of a Cameraman, who ends
                    up getting caught or killed by the Skibidi Toilets at the end of almost every episode. Both parties
                    use increasingly powerful weapons to aid their advances.
                    <br>
                    In later episodes, other types of humanoids appear, which have TV or speakers for their heads. Some
                    characters are much larger and more powerful than their normal counterparts.
                    <br>
                    Game Rant said the series lacked a coherent plot until episode 3, but began to expand on the lore
                    starting from episode 10.

                <p>
                    Skibidi Toilet was created by Alexey Gerasimov, better known as "DaFuq!?Boom!" and "Blugray", an
                    animator on YouTube. Since 2014, he has been learning animation on his own without formal education.
                    He lives in Georgia. His channel has produced a few prior viral hits, such as when his video I'M AT
                    DIP accumulated over 45 million views.
                    <br>
                    Every episode is produced using Source Filmmaker, a Valve-published 3D computer graphics software.
                    The creator has said he uses this software because "it allows me to work easier and faster with
                    assets that I need doing animation, direction, writing, and editing myself." The music prominently
                    featured in the series was popularized due to a TikTok dance video posted by the user
                    @yasincengiz38, which was also an internet meme before the series release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The creator of Skibidi Toilet cites TikTok user Paryss Bryanne's adaptation of this meme as
                    inspiration for his series, in which Bryanne moves in a jerky fashion with quick cuts. Some assets
                    are taken from video games Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source,[9] and Garry's Mod.[10] The most
                    notable of the Skibidi Toilet models (pictured in infobox) uses the head of a Civilian (Male_07)
                    from Half-Life 2.

            <article>
                <p>The magazine Dazed said that Skibidi Toilet is "frenetic, unpredictable, funny and at times genuinely
                    unsettling". According to Distractify, the channel is popular with a younger viewer base. Many
                    sources highlighted a viral tweet, in which a user @AnimeSerbia called the series Generation Alpha's
                    Slender Man.</p>

                <p>According to Tubefilter rankings, by the end of April 2023, "DaFuq!?Boom!" entered the fifty most
                    viewed YouTube channels in the United States, at 33rd place. Editor Sam Gutelle remarked that
                    animators "used to struggle with the demands of the YouTube algorithm; now it’s possible to get
                    millions of views with a bunch of pixelated toilets." By June, the channel had achieved a milestone
                    of five billion views, making it most the viewed YouTube channel in the US during that month.
                    Gutelle noted that until recent months, the channel existed largely under the radar, except for a
                    few "animation diehards in the meme community".</p>

                <p>Trend specialist Phil Ranta explained that the serialization of the series made it so that "people
                    had a reason to come back". They also explained the series' "genuine" feel and just plain luck
                    boosted its popularity. Skibidi Toilet have sparked many fans to create and post fanworks on TikTok.
